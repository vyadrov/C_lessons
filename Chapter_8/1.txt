Over the next seven hours or so, Trump took aim at everything and anyone he could,
unleashing a barrage of more than 30 tweets and retweets that targeted media outlets, high profile commentators and hosts, and Democrats.
He also returned once more to the Russia probe and impeachment, promoting a tweet
that accused his political adversaries of three failed coup attempts.
The tweet went on to suggest with no evidence that the presidents opponents
could attempt to steal the election by making the novel coronavirus impact on human lives seem worse than it really is.
D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on Tuesday downplayed concerns about Congress returning next
week to Washington a city under a stay-at-home order that she issued saying the work of the natios lawmakers is essential.
We know essential workers in hospitals and grocery stores, our sanitation workers,
all are reporting to work because they have essential jobs to do, Bowser said during an interview on CNN. And the work of the Congress
is essential, especially now, when workers need relief, when small businesses need relief and when state and local governments need relief. So the Congress needs to get to work.
Bowser said she assumes that many congressional staff members will continue to engage in telework and that her administration is in touch with the Architect of the Capitol
about putting the appropriate social distancing restrictions in place.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday that his chamber would return to Washington next week to conduct critical business in person. Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steny H.
